## üîñ Project Overview

### Web3 Interactive Learning Platform based on Ethereum to help every Web3 newbie become a Web3 Hacker

Our learning platform is a relatively cost-effective option for users who want to learn or are just getting started in the Web3 industry.

  - It can present different learning paths based on users' different learning responses.
  
    - Interactions are implemented in the chat window where users can execute specified options to enter different workflows.


  - Implemented through smart contracts:
  
    - Course certification NFT/SBT is automatically distributed through a series of contract interactions.


    - Users can earn community tokens by completing chapters or other actions, such as contributing to the learning website or correcting errors.


  - Let more people who are interested in Web3-related knowledge provide them with a very low learning threshold, **truly starting from zero to learn Web3**. Also, let them explore and actually touch some Web3-related examples - such as NFT, DAO.


  
## üëç Project Features

- Always ensure the fun of interaction content

   1. By adding examples after abstract conceptual knowledge, such as Web1.0-Personal blog-Only Writing
   
   2. Increase the fun of interaction by adding emojis in the conversation

- Ensure scientific learning amount for each lesson

   1. The amount of information for each knowledge popularization reply is limited in the chat box to ensure that learners can complete the learning process in a relatively relaxed state.

   2. By adding branch options for learners' feelings about the learning content, such as after discussing Web1.0 concepts:

     - Option 1: Haven't used Web1.0, not very familiar
     - Option 2: I've heard of it!

   The final learning path of the user will be completely different after choosing the two options. 

   The differences between various paths can ensure that learners can master the knowledge points through different paths during the learning process, ensuring our main feature in this project: **interactivity**
